<h1 align="center">✨ Awesome Dotfiles ✨</h1>

This is a Windows port of JavaCafe01's AwesomeWM creation, which you can find [here](https://github.com/JavaCafe01/dotfiles)

I tried to keep to the original as much as possible, copying the css and newtab page. But many things were icompatible with Windows, so I had to recode them using Rainmeter.

To make this work, you'll need the following tools:

+ [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
+ [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
+ [TaskbarX](https://chrisandriessen.nl/taskbarx)
+ [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/)
+ [Lovelace by niivu](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/lovelace-Windows-10-Suite-820036284)
+ [My hosted newtab page](blu3jive001.github.io/)
+ [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
+ *And a brain*

I'd like to say thanks to the entire winthemers community for helping so much with this creation. To niivu for making the wonderful theme. And to Unixporn for telling me it didn't look good enough, so I didn't give up halfway through.

Enjoy, thanks.
