<h1 align="center">✨ Awesome Dotfiles ✨</h1>

This is a Windows port of JavaCafe01's AwesomeWM creation, which you can find [here](https://github.com/JavaCafe01/dotfiles)

This was my first Rainmeter skin I ever coded, please excuse the sloppy coding and numerous skin files. If this does get enough traction I will fully recode the suite.

To make this work, you'll need the following tools:

+ [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
+ [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
+ [TaskbarX](https://chrisandriessen.nl/taskbarx)
+ [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/)
+ [Lovelace by niivu](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/lovelace-Windows-10-Suite-820036284)
+ [My hosted newtab page](https://blu3jive001.github.io/)
+ [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
+ *And a brain*

I'd like to say thanks to the entire winthemers community for helping so much with this creation. To niivu for making the wonderful theme. And to Unixporn for telling me it didn't look good enough, so I didn't give up halfway through.

Enjoy, 
Thanks
